# Solana-NFT-Unique-Holders-Checker 
This is a simple Typescript script that takes in a Solana NFT projects Candy Machine V1 ID and outputs the number of unique holders of a 1/1 NFT project (Unique Mint Address).

The program retrieves all mint addresses associated with a Candy Cane V1 ID, it then adds all owners to a set and prints the length of the set.

This program uses https://ssc-dao.genesysgo.net (line 8), you can speed up the process by using your own endpoint.

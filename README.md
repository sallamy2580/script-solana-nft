* If you do not know your candy machine ID, at the time of writting this, magiceden has an open endpoint at https://api-mainnet.magiceden.io/all_collections (ctrl f search your project, property: candyMachineIds). 
* If your project is not present with MagicEden and the script is no help try searching your nft on https://explorer.solana.com/ by its mint address. The ID should be a signature address in the very first transaction.
